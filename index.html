    <h1>EzReminder Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>This privacy policy governs your use of the software application EzReminder (“Application”) for mobile devices that was created by Kuro App Works.</p>

    <h2>1. User Provided Information and Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The Application's core functionality is to manage and display reminders. All data you input into the Application, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reminder Title and Description</li>
        <li>Date, Time, and Repeat Settings</li>
        <li>Custom Color and Notification Settings (Sound, Vibrate, Full Screen)</li>
        <li>Contact Name and Phone Number (if you choose to link a contact to a reminder)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>are stored exclusively on your device (in the local Room database). <strong>No personal or private user data is transmitted to or stored on any external servers (including those of Kuro App Works) or third-party cloud services.</strong></p>

    <h2>2. Automatically Collected Information (Non-Personal)</h2>
    <p>The Application uses third-party services that may collect information automatically to provide their services. This information does not personally identify you.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advertising (Google AdMob):</strong> We use Google AdMob for advertisement purposes. AdMob may collect and use data about your app usage and device to serve personalized ads. For more information on how Google uses information from sites or apps that use their services, please visit: <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites" target="_blank">Google's Partner Policy</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Consent Management (Google User Messaging Platform - UMP):</strong> We use UMP to manage user consent for personalized advertising as required by privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA). UMP collects and processes information to determine and record your consent status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Handling of Contact Information</h2>
    <p>The Application includes a feature that allows you to link a contact (name and phone number) to a specific reminder. This process is initiated solely by your explicit action of:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Tapping the "Add from Contacts" button.</li>
        <li>Granting the necessary "READ_CONTACTS" permission.</li>
        <li>Selecting a contact from your device's contacts list.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Application only extracts the selected contact's name and phone number and stores this data locally within the reminder's entry in the device's private database. This contact data is used exclusively to display the contact information in the reminder details and to enable direct calling (via the device’s dialer app) when the reminder alarm is triggered. <strong>This contact information is not shared with any third party or external server.</strong></p>

    <h2>4. Security</h2>
    <p>We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information stored locally. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop or improve our Application.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy here. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes.</p>
